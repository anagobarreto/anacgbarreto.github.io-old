    <h1> About </h1>
    <p>I come from the Pearl of Atlantic, also known as Madeira Island. I studied Visual Arts during High School as I always had a passion for art. When I finished school, I decided to move to London to look for a better future. </p>
    <p>Since being in London I've been on customer support roles, but then realised it didn't interested me at all so I decided to expand my knowledge area. That was when I tried programming. I had a few friends in that area and it was super easy to ask for help or ask any questions relating to their jobs.</p>
    <p>I went online to try to complete some free courses but just found them to be a bit tedious and non-progressive as I would get distracted whilst doing them. I was a bit thrown off on the idea of becoming a programmer as it felt that it would be a bit harder if I only relied on online resources.</p>
    <p>After a couple of months, I decided to quit my job and prioritise my goals as I was totally unsatisfied on my job at the time and it became really monotonous. I wanted to learn new things everyday instead of felling like I was forgetting and becoming dumber. It was a harsh decision I must admit, and I'm shocked how I went with it.</p>
    <p>My boyfriend suggested that I would go to a boot camp or an immersive course as it would prepare me well for the future in this industry. I was a bit put off as it would be high priced and I had quit my job a few weeks before. After thinking I decided to get some help as the Immersive course would definitely be an investment for my future and would change my career prospects.</p>
    <p>Currently I'm waiting for the Web Development Immersive course to start in General Assembly as I've been granted a place. It'll start on the 20<sup>th</sup> March with the termination date on the 16<sup>th</sup> June. Meanwhile I'm learning as much as I can before the course so that I'm more comfortable.</p>
